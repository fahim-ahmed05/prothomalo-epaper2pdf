This PowerShell script simplifies the process of downloading images from the [Prothom Alo ePaper](https://epaper.prothomalo.com/) website and converting them into a neatly organized PDF file using ImageMagick.

## Requirements

- ImageMagick

## Setup

- Open Terminal/PowerShell.

- Type `winget install ImageMagick.ImageMagick --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements` and press Enter. Accept necessary permissions to install it.

**Download [prothomalo-epaper.bat](https://github.com/fahim-ahmed05/prothomalo-epaper2pdf/blob/main/prothomalo-epaper.bat)**
 
- Place it on your desktop or wherever you want but make sure that the folder path doesn't have any spaces.
- Double click on the `prothomalo-epaper.bat` file to run it.
- It'll ask for a folder, where you want to download the ePaper. Select the folder and again make sure that the folder path doesn't have any spaces.
